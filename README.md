# PAC-12 Football Statistics Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of football statistics within the PAC-12 conference. The primary goal is to extract insights and trends from the performance data of teams in this collegiate football division. Using this dataset, we aim to analyze team performances, player statistics, and other relevant metrics to provide a comprehensive overview of the conference's football dynamics.

## Key Features
 **Data Source**: The dataset includes detailed statistical data from various games within the PAC-12 conference. It covers a wide range of metrics such as points scored, yards gained, turnovers, and more.
 **Data Processing**: The raw data is cleaned and transformed to create a structured dataset for efficient analysis. Outliers and missing values are handled to ensure data integrity.
 **Statistical Analysis**: Various statistical methods and visualizations have been employed to discover trends in team performances, player efficiency, and game outcomes.
 **Dashboard Visualization**: An interactive Tableau dashboard is included to allow users to explore the dataset visually. The dashboard provides insights into team standings, player performance comparisons, and key statistics across seasons.
